TO BE ADDRESSED IN FUTURE ITERATIONS

I would like to make My Activities list more user friendly and appealing.
I would like for users to be able to view other user's activities upon request (adjust permissions)
I would like for users to make appointments with each other to play sports.
I would like for users to integrate scheduled sports activities with google calendar.

PLANNING AND PROBLEM SOLVING

For this project my planning involved the simplication of an initial idea, since a social media app is difficult in to implement for a beginner developer in the given timeframe. Planning also involved breaking down bigger tasks such as CRUD on the back and front end into smaller components.

My problem solving approach for this project involved troubleshooting errors appearing in the terminal and browser console as they arise by reviewing and restructuring existing code, looking at past examples, as well as troubleshooting with instructors and fellow developers.
